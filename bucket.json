Here, I learned how to truly construct full stack software applications for the modern web. Using the AGILE development process, I built web applications in HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, and Ruby. The majority of applications I have built have been based on the simple model-view-controller architecture, using RESTful routes and responsive web design.
